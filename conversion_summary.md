# Streamlit to Gradio Conversion Summary

This document outlines the key components of the Gradio application that replaced the original Streamlit version.

## 1. Main Application Structure
The main application is structured using Gradio's `Blocks` API, which allows for custom layouts and data flows. The application consists of two main tabs: "File Processing" and "Protein Visualization". The "File Processing" tab allows users to upload files, process them, and ask questions about the data. The "Protein Visualization" tab provides a dedicated interface for visualizing protein structures.

## 2. File Processing Functions
The application includes several functions for processing different file types:
- `process_fasta(file, username)`: Processes FASTA files, uploads them to S3, and returns the file path and a success message.
- `process_csv(file, username)`: Processes CSV files, uploads them to S3, and returns the DataFrame and a success message.
- `process_pdb(file, username)`: Processes PDB files, uploads them to S3, and returns the PDB content and a success message.
- `process_file(file, username)`: Determines the file type and calls the appropriate processing function.

## 3. Question Answering Function
The `answer_question(file, question, username)` function allows users to ask questions about their data. It determines the file type and processes the file accordingly:
- For FASTA files, it processes the file and runs a conversation using the `run_conversation` function.
- For CSV files, it processes the file, creates a `SmartDataframe`, and uses the `chat` method to answer the question.
- For PDB files, it processes the file and uses the `render_protein_file` function to visualize the protein structure.

Overall, the Gradio application maintains all existing functionality from the original Streamlit version while providing a more flexible and interactive user interface.
